# SmartParking
SmartParking is a platform that aims to facilitate the use of parking, where the goal is to avoid
crowds, save time and provide the user with easier use of the benefits of Artificial Intelligence. This
application is based on IUS parking lots. The main difference between the parking system used by
IUS and the system we will implement is that the system shows us how many cars there are in the
parking lot and which places are free. In addition to this, the application should contain how much
more time you spent in the parking lot, and calculate the price based on that. The new feature will
be to show the shortest way to a free parking space in the console that will be able to monitor an
authorized person and provide all possible information necessary.

## What real-world problem would it solve?
Currently, the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina regarding parking is not satisfactory. We will
often encounter catastrophic crowds, especially in larger cities such as Sarajevo. This application
offers optimized search for free parking spaces and showing the closest way to it. A common
problem with parking in Bosnia and Herzegovina is also non-payment. This app itself calculates how
much to pay based on the time spent in the parking lot. If this prototype proves to be good, it will be
able to be upgraded and used in all parking spaces in Bosnia and Herzegovina and not only in the IUS
parking lot.

## Functionalities of the software
• Basic Look – The software should appeal to the eyes of user in a very simplistics way so
everyone could use it without problem, ranging from 18-90 years old.
• Simple to Use – All the interface should be simple to use without any hidden gems and
difficulities.
• Calculating the price – Software should calculate the price on the given hour price.
• Showing the free spot – Every parking would be named in a code name (example: A1 to
B20), and it will shove the code of the free parking lot for you.
• Reservations – Through this app a user can reserve a parking for himself in advance
• Ads – This software would not have any ads as its purpouse is not money making nature.

## Implementation Technology
For this project we will use Python programming langugae and some of its frameworks like QT and
PyTorch. We will use QT for Graphical User Interface which is handy purely because of its simplistic
look, and PyTorch will be used as an Artifical Intelligence library.
